Note : Project currently on hiatus while i finish up my coursework and prepare for exams. 

Project cancelled to work on Iron age, which is somewhat similar, but different. Basically just ignore this repository, im keeping it up for reference code.

# ConQuest

Please note that this project is (currently) very early in development, and many of the features included in this document may undergo drastic changes, as well as potentially being removed from the project as a whole. thank you!

## Introduction

Conquest is a personal project of mine, it is developed both to improve my skills in working with c# and to learn the basics of game development. The project is currently only developed in my spare time, of which I have very little, so major updates are not frequent and will usually be released in small updates. Also most developments are created on a computer with very little RAM and very little storage space, so i will be attempting to use up as little space as possible while meeting as many project goals as possible. Conquest is written in c# and makes use of images, icons, notepad files and databases to function, these are included with the project.

## Gameplay

The objective of conquest is to build up a large empire (through building influence over villages) and using said empire to conquer the other players castles within the game. To achieve this the player is provided with units (as well as a method for obtaining more units later in the game) which can be moved, used to attack enemy units or used to capture villages (by becoming influential over them) and other strategic resources. Units also gain levels from killing enemy units (or the monsters which are scattered around the map) and increase one of their stats every three levels, once they reach their tenth level they are given the option to be promoted to a new unit tier, which will increase certain stats and/or provide passive bonuses. As previously mentioned, units may capture villages, which will have either an armory (which allows units to be purchased with production, which is slowly accumulated at a rate of 1 per turn) or a market (which allows existing units to purchase new weaponry, armour or crit abilities). Villages may also produce a quest, in which a unit is instructed to slay a unique monster, completing this objective will reward the player with a legendary item (weapon, armour or soul) or a large sum of gold, they will also be provided with a passive buff that only they may own, lasting until the end of the game or the death of the unit.

The game is won when one player is able to take influence over another players castle, eliminating that player from the game and destroying all their units (collected villages will simply become unclaimed to avoid players becoming too powerful after conquering their first castle)

## Please note

The islands folder that is included in the master is completley irrelevant, it serves no purpose and is only there because i keep forgetting to remove it. (This refers to the islands folder that is found within the master branch and is not in any other folders, the islands file in the conquest document is very important, and the game will not run without it)
